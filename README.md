Establishing [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) connection consists of multiple asynchronous steps where data is exchanged over the network:
* communication with [STUN/TURN servers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Protocols)
* communication with [signaling server (Firebase in this case)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity#signaling)

 Error handling and connection reset is tricky and can result in [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/).

The project presents:
* approach to establishing a reliable WebRTC connection every time two peers try to connect to each other.
* error handling and reliable connection reset

Technologies used:
* [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)
* [Swift programming language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)
* [Swift structured concurrency](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html)
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
* [Firebase firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

## Core algorithm

Two peers connecting to each other are called: `host` and `guest`. Core algorithm consists of two main steps:
* SDP exchange
* ICE candidates exchange

Each step has a timeout associated to it - if the step is not completed within the timeframe the whole flow is reset.
The flow can also be reset due to peer clearing it's connection data (SDP, ICE candidates) on signaling server. Clearing connection data is done in the outer connection loop. This could happen e.g. due to connection timeout.

## Signaling server

>Unfortunately, WebRTC can't create connections without some sort of server in the middle. We call this the signal channel or signaling service. It's any sort of channel of communication to exchange information before setting up a connection, whether by email, postcard, or a carrier pigeon. It's up to you.

## Unit tests

Project contains multiple unit tests:
* `testSimultaneousConnection()`
* `testGuestConnectingFirst()`
* `testHostConnectingFirst()`
* `testHostDisconnected()`
* `testGuestDisconnected()`
* `testRandomConnectionScheme()`

```Swift
private func simulateConnection(
    _ chatRoomId: String,
    guestDelaySec: Int = 0,
    hostDelaySec: Int = 0) async
{
    let guestWebRTCManager = WebRTCManager()
    let hostWebRTCManager = WebRTCManager()
    let t = Task {
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000 * UInt64(guestDelaySec))
        await guestWebRTCManager.retryConnect(
            chatRoomId: chatRoomId,
            currentPeer: WebRTCManager.peer.guest
        )
    }
    let t2 = Task {
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000 * UInt64(hostDelaySec))
        await hostWebRTCManager.retryConnect(
            chatRoomId: chatRoomId,
            currentPeer: WebRTCManager.peer.host
        )
    }
    let t3 = Task {
        for await connectionState in guestWebRTCManager.connectionState {
            if connectionState == .connected {
                t.cancel()
                break
            }
        }
    }
    let t4 = Task {
        for await connectionState in hostWebRTCManager.connectionState {
            if connectionState == .connected {
                t2.cancel()
                break
            }
        }
    }
    await t3.value
    await t4.value
}
```

## Setup guide

* Create a new [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/)
* Add iOS app to the newly created Firebase project
* Download GoogleService-Info.plist and put it into VideoChat directory of the project
* Create Cloud Firestore database (Test mode) in Firebase Console

## Troubleshooting

App crashes reporting deadlock - experienced on XCode 15, iOS 17 emulators. 

There is no camera on emulator. Try running app on your phone and Mac (MacOS designed for iPad).
